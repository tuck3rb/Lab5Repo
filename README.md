# The Rascal KING
-----------------

<ins>The intent of your game:</ins>

Collect CDs, burn them onto your own collection, and use the money earned from pirating to support Big Vegas' lifestyle. The more money you put in your wallet, the more Big Vegas can twerk to the music, dancing to the beat of his pirated tunes and fueling his habit by buying even more CDs.

<ins>Narrative Structure:</ins>

Step into the platform shoes of Big Vegas, a washed up singer who trudges through the desolate, pitiful streets of a suburban cityscape, collecting and pirating CDs to barely make a living. As you wander through the dreary landscape, the only sounds you hear are the echoes of your footsteps and the melancholic tunes of pirated music.

Each pirated CD earns you a meager sum, barely enough to keep your head above water in a surreal, pirated music purgatory. But the desire for a better life is too great to resist, and you continue to scour the city for more CDs, constantly avoiding the reign of Boss.

As you progress through the game, the reality of your situation becomes clear. There is no escape from this life of piracy and desperation. Despite your best efforts, the city's corrupt system is rigged against you, Big Vegas will never return from exile.

<ins>Mechanics:</ins>

The mechanics are basic, use WASD or the Arrow Keys to move around and pan the camera by moving the mouse. Click on CDs to collect them and click on your computer to subsequently burn them. Different hotkeys support different dance moves.

<ins>Aesthetics:</ins>

- 3D suburban environment with three locations: Vegasâ€™ apartment, the CD shop, and the streets.
- Big Vegas' eirely familiar persona is completed with ridiculous proportions and a common "sad idle" state.
- The music is license-free and stems from different genres including THIS, THIS, and THIS.
- The game also includes multiple hotkeys for dancing animations such as Gangnam Style, twerking, and more.
- CDs glow to show they are selectable.

<ins>Struggles while writing this game:</ins>
WE NEED TO FILL THIS OUT

<ins>Joys while writing this game:</ins>
A joy in creating the game was absolutely putting together all of the aesthetics to make quite a hilarious game with a fun premise. The character Big Vegas and his sad reality was certainly a joy to run with and build upon.

<ins>Contributions:</ins>
Tucker created the Github, Unity 3D core, Design Doc, and Teams chat. Then, Noah and Kaden imported the Big Vegas model and his city environment assets. Noah chose 10 royalty-free songs for the CDs. We used some scripts from Ethan's last game to create the movement for the player. Kaden created the animation and functionality of the CD and CD burning. Tucker updated the README.md, found the door asset, and created the controls page. Noah incorporated the assets for the inside of Big Vegas' home and binded dances to different buttons. Finally, Tucker created the menus/transitions and uploaded the game to Itch. ADD ETHAN CONTRIBUTIONS.
